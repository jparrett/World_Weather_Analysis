# World Weather Analysis
Module 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to utilize Python and various APIs to gather weather and travel data for the consumer.

# Deliverable One - WeatherPy Database
For the first part of the project, 2,000 random latitude and longitude combinations were generated.     Utilzing the Citypy resouce, those random combinations were utlized to find the closest cities.   The next step was to determine the weather conditions for those cities.    Using the Weather Map API, the weather locations of the cities were added to a final databse.   

# Deliverable Two - Vacation Search
This part of the project was to use customer input to determine cities that would fit the vacation requirements of the user.     The user is asked to input a minimum and maximum temperature.   This is then crossreference to the previous weather database to filter for a list of desired cities.    After the cities are establised, Google API is utilized to determine hotel names.     A new .csv and map is created.

# Deliverable Three
For the final step a vacation iteneary was created.   For our trip we will be traveling between four cities in Australia.    After establishing four cities that met our criteria in the first deliverables, more infmoration was needed for the customer.   The cities were placed into a database.   Using google maps, map markers were placed for each of the cities with associated hotels and weather information displayed.

# Conclusion
Throughtout this analysis, we were able to start with 2,000 random points, retreive weather information, filter based on weather, locate hotels and finally determine a route for the consumer.    This will allow consumers to quickly pinpoint areas that would be ideal for their vacation and know all the associated facts. for those locations.
